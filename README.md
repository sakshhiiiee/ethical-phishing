# Ethical Phishing Simulation Platform

##  Project Overview

This project is a phishing simulation platform developed using Flask. It is intended for educational and ethical cybersecurity training purposes. The application mimics a fake login page and captures user-submitted credentials, immediately following up with an awareness message to educate the user about phishing risks.

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask Web Framework
- HTML/CSS
- SQLite (for future enhancement)
- SMTP (planned for email delivery)

##  How It Works

1. A user is directed to a fake login page designed to look like a legitimate login screen.
2. When login credentials are entered, the backend logs the data to simulate credential theft.
3. The user is then presented with an awareness message explaining the phishing attempt and providing security tips.

## Disclaimer

This platform is for "educational purposes only". It is intended to raise awareness about phishing techniques and to help organizations train employees in identifying and avoiding phishing attacks.
